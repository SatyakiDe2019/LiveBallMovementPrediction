# Predicting ball movement from live sports using Open-CV Python & Kalman filter.

## About this package

This computer-vision package will invoke the python script that will instantiate the class to initiate the prediction capability & display the predicted line from a live Sports streaming by analyzing the individual frames. This application developed using Open-CV. This project is for the advanced Python developer & Data Science Newbi's.


## How to use this package

(The following instructions apply to Posix/bash. Windows users should check
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).)

First, clone this repository and open a terminal inside the root folder.

Create and activate a new virtual environment (recommended) by running
the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the Live Prediction App:

```bash
python predictBodyLine.py
```

Make sure that you are properly connected with a functional WebCam or scanned images (Preferably a separate external WebCAM).
